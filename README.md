# MobiusApplication
Mobius Application allows lecturers to view, edit and duplicate each other’s lesson plans. It has LXD Notes and LXD Timeline features that can help lecturers be more effective in the classroom by providing a detailed outline of each class period. In addition, a detailed lesson plan can help in the learning process of students. All lesson plans can be generated out into PDFs.

### Main Objective
The objective is to create a site for Nanyang Polytechnic’s lecturers to collaborate in creating lesson plans. At Mobius Application, they can comment on each other’s lesson plans, copy and paste few chunks of LXD Notes and LXD Timeline to create a new lesson plan and generate lesson plans in PDFs out easily.
